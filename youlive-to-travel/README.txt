== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I upload trips? =

Login or Signup at https://youli.io then click 'Create Trip'. Once you have added the itinerary and details, you can make it 'Public' -> 'Listed'. Then it will be visible 

= Why aren't my trips appearing when I use the short code? =

Check that your trips are all set to 'Public' -> 'Listed'. If they are and you still don't see them, your account may not have the wordpress plugin enabled. If you are 'Explorer' then you'll need to UPGRADE to be able to list your trips using the wordpress plugin. If you still have issues, open a support ticket support @ youli.io
